# Crypto-Predictions
Another Ai model. This one can be used to process and predict future crypto prices. Not recommended for real life use, of course, as the market is not straight forward.

Lessons Learned: I learned a bit more about training a model to predict to the best of its abilities using a given data set. This project was a bit trickier, but maily due to the plotting of multiple lines that can all fit into the graph and work nicely with each other. Learning about using Ai as a tool for predicitons was very interesting, and I hope to make a more complex model soon.
